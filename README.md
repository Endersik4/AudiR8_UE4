# AudiR8_UE4
The second game I created on 29/10/2021. It shows a 3D Model of an AudiR8 that I made myself (with tutorials) in about 50-60h in blender. This game was supposed to be about simply showing this car as well as possible but instead I decided to add a lot of other things. At the end there is a Blur that shouldn't be there and the soundtrack that is in the background was created by my Sister. All the models that are in this game are from the net I only made this "Showroom" and the AudiR8, which doesn't change the fact that there was still a lot to do - it took me about 2 months to do it
